    <h1>My idea(s) for peace in the middle east</h1>
    <p>In very few words, this is my idea:</p>
    <h2>
    	<ol>
    		<li>Everybody prays</li>
    		<li>Coin flip</li>
    		<li>Winner gets Gaza for 50 years</li>
    	</ol>
    </h2>
    <p>The "50 year" timeframe could be adjusted. An agreement could state that the Palestinians get some extra land around Gaza if they win, but none if they lose. If world military alliances like NATO agreed to abide by the result of the coin flip things could probably be further stabilized. Surely Allah and Yahweh are powerful enough to influence a coin flip? If both sides are concerned that the other side might somehow be "rigging their coin", both sides could coin flip: matching means party A wins, different means party B wins. Allah and Yahweh might choose to take or give land based on sin/righteousness/prayer, so losers have no right to contest the result. Secular people probably just want peace, so this is a quick way to get there. Perhaps Gaza and/or surrounding territory could be divided into 2 or more chunks so that there is a higher statistical likelihood of everybody getting something.</p>
    <p><i>Flipping a coin can end arguments; it settles disputes between powerful opponents. - Proverbs 18:18</i></p>
    <p>There is probably more to think about with this idea, but I want to throw it out there to the world and get people thinking.</p>
